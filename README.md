# Save Nudge HUD for Blender

A lightweight viewport HUD that gently reminds you to save your work.  
It tracks your activity (keyboard, mouse, etc.) and shows a small ring indicator that fills over time.  
When it’s full, the ring flashes red and says **“Please save”**.  
Saving your file resets it with a smooth green fade.
